# ShinyTrades
A place to make my trading strategy shine.


# Current Project List

## Obfuscate Levels

To protect ourselves, we need to obfuscate proprietary levels.

## Creaate Trading Log

Our log needs to allow us to track trades that we take as well as the trades that we do not take.


## Finish Strategy Framework

Along with coding, this will require lots of testing.


## Create a Profit/Loss Statement By Symbol

One of our goals is to understand what we are trading and learn for our successes and mistakes.  To do that, we want to understand our 
how well we are doing by symbol.


## Validate Futures Meta Data

We need to simplify reality so that we can manage our trades with confidence.

### Validate Futures Symbol Roll Over Dates

Since the @FUTURES symbols roll over, we need to now which symbol we are trading even though we are charting the @FUTURES symbol.

### Validate Futures Pricing Data

When creating alerts and determining entries, we need to quickly understand what our risk/rewards are.


## Calibration

This is a longer term goal, but we want to start thinking about this now.
