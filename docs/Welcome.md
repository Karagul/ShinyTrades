# Welcome to Shiny Trades

## Disclaimer

This experimental web application is for educational (and if you are cruel, entertainment)
purposes only.  

While I hope to be able to eventually provide services and education to others, that is a long way off.

I have a day job and this project is very much an after hours endeavor.  
Therefore, most published versions will be for educational purposes.  As such, what you see is unvalidated and buggy.

## Instructions

To get started, use the links at the left.  I will be adding documentation as I go along.

## Goals

### Continuing Education

I am building this app as part of my continuing education in the following areas:

* Data Science
* Programing R
    * Create reusuable packages
    * Reproducable research
    * Interactive web applications
* Programing TradeStation's Easy Language
    * Integrating Easy Language with R
    * Building indicators and show-mes.
    * Building strategies
* System integration
    * Using drop box
* Collaboration with others through
    * GitHub
    * StackExchange
    * Writing
* Trading
    * Technical trading analysis
    * Trading strategy implementation and back testing
    * Trading plan implementation and measurement

### Trading Plan

After I get further along with this project, I hope to be able to use this app as part of my trading plan.


### Retirement Plan

While retirement is still a ways off, it is likely that I will still need to generate some form of income.  
I believe this effort will prepare me for eventual retirement.  At this point, I am considering the following options for my retirement plan:

* Gig consulting (for profit and as volunteer)
    * SQL 
    * R
    * Easy Language
    * Custom indicators
    * Customer trading strategies
    * Trading strategy backtesting
* Trading
* Writing How-tos
