# Welcome to Shiny Trades

## Disclaimer

This experimental web application is for educational (and if you are cruel, entertainment)
purposes only.  

While I hope to be able to eventually provide services and education to others, that is a long way off.

I have a day job and this project is very much an after hours endeavor.  
Therefore, most published versions will be for educational purposes.  As such, what you see is unvalidated and buggy.

## Instructions

To get started, use the links at the left.  While I will try to make each page user-friendly, you can find the detailed documentation on the 
[companion website](http://mikebesso.github.io/ShinyTrades)

The search box on the left is a backdoor for me during the early development process.  It will disappear soon.  

## Opportunities for Others

It would be great to work with others on this project.  
If you would like to help out in any way, just let me know.
